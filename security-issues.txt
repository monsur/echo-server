SECURITY ISSUES - Echo Server
=============================
Last Updated: 2025-10-05

## Critical Issues - FIXED ✓

1. JSON Parsing without Validation (echo-server.js:70-121)
   STATUS: FIXED
   - Added 10KB size limit for JSON parameters
   - Implemented prototype pollution detection (__proto__, constructor, prototype)
   - Added depth validation (max 10 levels) to prevent DoS
   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - 8 unit tests added to verify fix

2. Arbitrary Header Injection (echo-server.js:150-230)
   STATUS: FIXED
   - Implemented RFC 7230 compliant header name validation
   - Added CRLF injection prevention for header values
   - Whitelisted allowed root keys (headers, statusCode, reasonPhrase, body, condition)
   - Enforced strict header depth validation (only headers.X-Name allowed)
   - 7 unit tests added to verify fix

3. No Rate Limiting
   STATUS: NOT ADDRESSED
   - Recommendation: Implement rate limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit)
   - Note: This is a deployment/infrastructure concern

## Moderate Issues - FIXED ✓

4. Missing Input Validation (echo-server.js:123-136, 205-229, 65-68)
   STATUS: FIXED
   - Status codes validated to be between 100-599
   - Request body size limited to 1MB via Express middleware
   - reasonPhrase limited to 100 characters and validated for CRLF
   - Body parameter limited to 1MB and validated for nesting
   - 10 unit tests added to verify fix

5. Information Disclosure (echo-server.js:183)
   STATUS: PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
   - Error messages now use generic "Internal Server Error"
   - Console logging still present (for debugging purposes)
   - Recommendation: Add production mode with reduced logging

6. No Security Headers
   STATUS: NOT ADDRESSED
   - Recommendation: Add helmet middleware
   - Note: This is a deployment/infrastructure concern

## Low-Risk - FIXED ✓

7. Deprecated url.parse() (echo-server.js:70-73)
   STATUS: FIXED
   - Replaced deprecated url.parse() with modern URL API
   - Now uses native URL constructor and searchParams
   - 2 unit tests added to verify URL parsing works correctly

8. No HTTPS Support
   STATUS: NOT ADDRESSED
   - Only runs on HTTP
   - Recommendation: Add HTTPS support for production
   - Note: Often handled at reverse proxy/load balancer level

## Dependency Security

Dependencies are clean (0 vulnerabilities per npm audit).

## Test Coverage Summary

Total Tests: 33
- Basic functionality: 6 tests
- JSON security: 8 tests
- Header injection security: 7 tests
- Input validation: 12 tests

All tests passing ✓

## Security Fixes Applied

1. JSON parameter validation (size, depth, prototype pollution)
2. Header injection prevention (name/value validation, whitelisting)
3. Input validation (status codes, body size, reasonPhrase)
4. Request body size limits (1MB via Express middleware)
5. Replaced deprecated url.parse() with modern URL API

## Remaining Recommendations

1. Consider adding helmet middleware for security headers
2. Implement rate limiting for production deployments
3. Add production mode with reduced logging
4. Consider HTTPS support or document reverse proxy requirements
